## Featured Projects 🌟

- [**Scikitty**](https://github.com/yourusername/scikitty): Lead and key developer of Scikitty, a Python package inspired by Scikit-learn, featuring custom-built models from scratch.
  - Included an advanced Decision Tree class with features such as direct handling of categorical features (no need for numerization or binarization), visual tree representation, and the ability to save/load tree structures in JSON.
  - Seamless integration with Prolog for transforming ML models into Rule-Based systems.
  - Surpassed Scikit-learn by eliminating the need for numerization, saving preprocessing steps, and providing superior explainability through graphical visualization included in the package and parameterized impurity criteria.
  - Demonstrated excellent knowledge of computer science and artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning and rule-based systems.
  - Showcased outstanding programming and problem-solving abilities to achieve functionality comparable to industry standards.
